# Convoy's Game of Life

This application is developed with the help of only the Standard Python Libraries and Python


## Code Description

### Python Files
- [game_of_life.py](game_of_life.py): The main file
- [test_life.py](test_life.py): File containing all the test cases

### JSON Files
- [data.json](data.json): contains the starting data of all the different simulations
- [soultions.json](solutions.json): contains the soulutions to all the simulations in [data.json](data.json)


## Developing

Downloading the code and making it ready for execution

```shell
git clone https://github.com/laukikk/Game-of-Life.git
cd Game-of-Life
```


## Executing
There are two different ways to use this application


### Method 1: Run the Simulation
Open the Terminal

```shell
python .\game_of_life.py
```

### Method 2: Run the Test Cases
Open the Terminal

```shell
python .\test_life.py
```

Here the 3 tests cases are marked by a few of the multiple test cases on Still Lives, Oscillators and Spaceships as demonstrated [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns).
